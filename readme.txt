* New user is created via registration or by another user
* User changes the role, password or other profile settings of another user
* User on a WordPress multisite network is added or removed from a site 
* User uploads or deletes a file, changes a password or email address
* User installs, activates, deactivates, upgrades or uninstalls a plugin
* User creates a new post, page, category or a custom post type
* User modifies an existing post, page, category or a custom post type
* User creates, modifies or deletes a custom field from a post, page or custom post type
* User adds, moves, modifies or deletes a widget
* User installs or activates a new WordPress theme
* User changes WordPress settings such as permalinks or administrator notification email
* WordPress is updated / upgraded
* Failed login attempts
* and much more...

Refer to the complete list of [WordPress Security Audit Alerts](http://www.wpsecurityauditlog.com/documentation/list-monitoring-wordpress-security-alerts-audit-log/) for more information on what WordPress activity can be monitored with WP Security Audit Log.

= Monitor WordPress Users Activity & Productivity =

* When WordPress users log in or out
* From where WordPress users are logging in

Refer to the complete list of [WordPress Security Audit Alerts](http://www.wpsecurityauditlog.com/documentation/list-monitoring-wordpress-security-alerts-audit-log/) for more information on what other WordPress user activity can be monitored with the WP Security Audit Log WordPress plugin.

= Get Notified Instantly of Changes on Your WordPress =
<strong>Get notified instantly via email of important changes happening on your blogs and websites running on WordPress and WordPress multisite.</strong>

Use the premium [Email Notifications Add-On](http://www.wpsecurityauditlog.com/extensions/wordpress-email-notifications-add-on/) to configure monitoring rules and get notified via email of specific actions. For example you can setup notifications rules to be alerted via email should any WordPress user logs in to your WordPress outside office hours. The email alerts include all the details a WordPress administrator or owner might need, such as the source IP address, user, user role, date, time, details about the actual action and much more.

= Use Free Text Based Searches to Search for Specific Activity on WordPress =
<strong>The search functionality allows you to quickly find specific WordPress activity you are looking for.</strong>

It is virtually impossible to find specific WordPress activity by manually browsing through thousands of WordPress security alerts. Now you can use the premium [Search Add-On](http://www.wpsecurityauditlog.com/extensions/search-add-on-for-wordpress-security-audit-log/) to do free text based searches in the WordPress audit log, allowing you to easily pin point specific WordPress user, site, plugin, theme and other activity.

For example you can generate a WordPress user or group of users activity report, specific role activity report and also site activity report in case you are running WordPress multisite. Unlike other WordPress reports plugins, WSAL Reporting Extension does not have templates that restrict you to specific reports types, but it allows you to choose any data source for your reports.
