= 4.0.2 (2020-02-28) =

* **Security fix**

	* Added authentication check for the first-time install wizard. This addresses an edge case in which if the wizard was never completed by the user, unauthenticated users could run the wizard and gain acccess to plugin settings.
	
* **Improvements**

	* Removed the setting / functionality to allow access to users with non-admin role to the plugin settings. Now users who require access to the plugin settings need to have the admin role.
	* Removed the "activity log view access" and the "exclude objects" steps from the install wizard. These are advanced settings.
	* Check the role of users trying to import settings file and deny if it does not have admin role.
