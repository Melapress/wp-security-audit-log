### WordPress changes and details WP Activity Log keeps track of
A website activity log is an important tool in improving troubleshooting, compliance, user management, and security.
Get WP Activity Log and keep track of events on your site. The log not only tells you that a post, a user profile, or an object was updated, it also lets you know exactly what changed, when, and includes a user log (by whom) so you always have the information you need.

Below is a summary of the changes that the plugin can keep a record of:

- **Post, page and custom post type changes** such as status, content changes, title, URL, custom field, and other metadata changes

- **Tags and category changes** such as creating, modifying or deleting them, and adding or removing them from posts

- **Widget and menu changes** such as creating, modifying, or deleting them

- **User changes** such as user created or registered, deleted, or added to a site on multisite network

- **User profile changes** such as password, email, display name, and role changes

- **Access logging** such as user login, logout, failed logins, and terminating other sessions

- **WordPress core and settings changes** such as installed updates, permalinks, default role, URL, and other site-wide changes

- **WordPress multisite network changes** such as adding, deleting or archiving sites, adding or removing users from sites, etc.

- **Plugin and Theme changes** such as installing, activating, deactivating, uninstalling, and updating

- **WordPress database changes** such as when a plugin adds or removes a table

- Changes to **WooCommerce Stores & products**, **Yoast SEO**, **WPForms**, **Gravity Forms**, **Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)**, **MainWP** and other popular WordPress plugins.

- <strong> WordPress site file changes </strong> such as new files are added, or existing ones are modified or deleted.

Detailed event logging ensures that for every event that the plugin records, it reports the:

* Date & time (and milliseconds) of when it happened
* User & role of the user who did the change
* Source IP address from where the change happened
* The object on which the change has taken place

Refer to [WordPress activity log event IDs](https://melapress.com/support/kb/wp-activity-log-list-event-ids/?utm_source=wp+repo&utm_medium=repo+link&utm_campaign=wordpress_org&utm_content=wsal) for a complete list of all the changes WP Activity Log can keep a record of and a detailed explanation of what change every event ID represents.
