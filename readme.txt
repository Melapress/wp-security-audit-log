* User uploads or deletes a file, changes a password or email address
* User installs, activates, deactivates, upgrades or uninstalls a plugin
* User creates a new post, page, category or a custom post type
* User modifies an existing post, page, category or a custom post type
* User adds, moves, modifies or deletes a widget
* User installs or activates a theme
* WordPress settings are changed
* WordPress is upgraded
* Failed login attempts
* and much more...
