### WordPress Changes & Details the Plugin Keeps a Log Of
As a comprehensive & complete WordPress activity log solution WP Activity Log does not just tell you that a post, a user profile, or an object was updated. It tells you exactly what was changed within the post, the user profile, or the object.

Below is a summary of the changes that the plugin can keep a record of:

* **Post, Page and Custom Post Type changes** such as status, [content changes](https://wpactivitylog.com/support/kb/how-keep-record-of-content-changes/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=WSAL&utm_content=plugin+repos+description), title, URL, custom field & other metadata changes

For every event that the plugin records it also reports the:

* Source IP address from where the change happened,
* The object on which the change has taken place.
