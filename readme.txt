* New user is created via registration or by another user
* User changes the role, password or other profile settings of another user
* User on a WordPress multisite network is added or removed from a site 
* User uploads or deletes a file, changes a password or email address
* User installs, activates, deactivates, upgrades or uninstalls a plugin
* User creates a new post, page, category or a custom post type
* User modifies an existing post, page, category or a custom post type
* User creates, modifies or deletes a custom field from a post, page or custom post type
* User adds, moves, modifies or deletes a widget
* User installs or activates a new WordPress theme
* User changes WordPress settings such as permalinks or administrator notification email
* WordPress is updated / upgraded
* Failed login attempts
* and much more...

Refer to the complete list of [WordPress Security Audit Alerts](http://www.wpsecurityauditlog.com/documentation/list-monitoring-wordpress-security-alerts-audit-log/) for more information on what WordPress activity can be monitored with WP Security Audit Log.

= Get Notified Instantly of Changes on Your WordPress =
<strong>Get notified instantly via email of important changes happening on your blogs and websites running on WordPress and WordPress multisite.</strong>

Use the premium [Email Notifications Add-On](http://www.wpsecurityauditlog.com/extensions/wordpress-email-notifications-add-on/) to configure monitoring rules and get notified via email of specific actions.

<strong>The search functionality allows you to quickly find specific WordPress activity you are looking for.</strong>

It is virtually impossible to find specific WordPress activity by manually browsing through thousands of WordPress security alerts.

Unlike other WordPress reports plugins, WSAL Reporting Extension does not have templates that restrict you to specific reports types, but it allows you to choose any data source for your reports.
